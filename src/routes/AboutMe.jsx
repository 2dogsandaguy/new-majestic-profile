            In the dynamic world of material handling and crane 
            technology, I am Robert Friscoâ€”a seasoned professional
            with a comprehensive skill set in installation, repair,
            and fabrication. As a dedicated Service Technician and 
            Team Leader, my journey is marked by a proven ability to
            lead successful projects, wear multiple hats, and thrive

            windmill projects. Armed with a GWO certification and 
            strong problem-solving acumen, I am not just a technician.
